But who wants to be average?! \n\nYou have been asked to support an investment firm by analyzing trends in high-growth companies. They are interested in understanding which industries are producing the highest valuations and the rate at which new high-value companies are emerging. Providing them with this information gives them a competitive insight as to industry trends and how they should structure their portfolio looking forward.\n\nYou have been given access to their `unicorns` database, which contains the following tables:\n\n## dates\n| Column       | Description                                  |\n|------------- |---------------------------------------------

the year that they became a unicorn (3), and their average valuation, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places (4).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n\n**1.Finding the top industries**\n\nUse a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify the top performing industries in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined based on volume of unicorns.\n\n\n\n**2.Gathering yearly rankings data**\n\nBuild a second
